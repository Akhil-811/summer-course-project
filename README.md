Anomaly Detection is the technique of identifying rare events or observations which can raise suspicions by being statistically different from the rest of the observations. Such “anomalous” behaviour typically translates to some kind of a problem like a credit card fraud, failing machine in a server, a cyber attack, etc.
An anomaly can be broadly categorized into three categories –
1.Point Anomaly: A tuple in a dataset is said to be a Point Anomaly if it is far off from the rest of the data.
2.Contextual Anomaly: An observation is a Contextual Anomaly if it is an anomaly because of the context of the observation.
3.Collective Anomaly: A set of data instances help in finding an anomaly.
# Accuracy alone can not determine if a model is good or bad but accuracy combined with precision, recall, and F1 Score can give a good idea about the performance of the model.
